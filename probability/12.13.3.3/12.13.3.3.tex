\textbf{12.13.3.3}\\
Of the students in a college, it is known that 60\% reside in hostel and 40\% are day scholars (not residing in hostel). Previous year results report that 30\% of all students who reside in hostel attain A grade and 20\% of day scholars attain A grade in their annual examination. At the end of the year, one student is chosen at random from the college and he has an A grade, what is the probability that the student is a hostlier?
\subsection*{Solution}
Using Baye's Rule:\\
Let the probability of students living in hostel be $\pr{H=1}$, therefore the students who are day scholars can be given as $\pr{H=0}$\\
The probability of the students getting grade A is given as $\pr{A=1}$.\\
By given information,
\begin{table}
	\input{tables/table1.tex}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
        \input{tables/table2.tex}
\end{table}

Thus,
\begin{align}
	\pr{A=1} &= \sum_{i=0}^1 \pr{A = 1 \mid H = i}\pr{H=i}
\end{align}
\begin{multline}
	\pr{A=1} = \pr{A = 1 \mid H = 0}\pr{H = 0}\\
	+\pr{A = 1 \mid H = 1}\pr{H = 1}
\end{multline}
\begin{align}
	\pr{A=1} &= \left(\frac{20}{100} \times \frac{40}{100}\right)+\left(\frac{30}{100} \times \frac{60}{100}\right)\\
	\pr{A=1} &= \frac{26}{100}\\
	\pr{H=1 \mid A=1} &= \frac{\pr{A=1 \mid H=1}\pr{H=1}}{\pr{A=1}}\\
	\pr{H=1 \mid A=1} &= \frac{9}{13}
\end{align}
The probability that the student is a hostlier who has A grade is $\frac{9}{13}$.
